Program Purpose:
    - The purpose of this program is to predict whether or not a baserunner 
        steals second base based on the runner's jump, the pitch velocity and
        the catcher.

Imports:
    - For this program, we decided to use three data tables:
        - fulltable.csv
            - This data table contains all the statcast stolen base data from
                the 2024 MLB season.
        - poptime.csv
            - This data table contains all the catcher's fielding data from 
                the 2024 MLB season.
        - runningsplits.csv
            - This data table contains all the running splits from 0 to 90 feet
                for baserunners in the MLB.
Using dataframes:
    - I used the fulltable.csv by filtering out the dataframe so that only 
        the user inputted baserunner remained in the dataframe.
    - I used the poptime.csv dataframe to get the 2B pop time on a stolen base 
        attempt on the user inputted cathcher.
    - I used the runningsplits.csv dataframe to find the running splits from \
        0 to 90 feet for the user inputted baserunner. 
Acknowledgements: 
    - I would like to thank Baseball Savent for providing the data used for 
        this project. I would also like to acknowledge that I used resources 
        from StackOverflow, ChatGPT and GeeksForGeeks.
