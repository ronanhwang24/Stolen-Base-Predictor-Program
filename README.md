## Program Purpose
The purpose of this program is to predict whether a baserunner successfully steals second base based on three primary factors:
- The runner’s jump  
- The pitch velocity  
- The catcher’s performance  

---

## Data Sources
This program uses three data tables:
- **fulltable.csv** — Contains all Statcast stolen base data from the 2024 MLB season.  
- **poptime.csv** — Contains catcher fielding data (pop times) from the 2024 MLB season.  
- **runningsplits.csv** — Contains baserunner sprint splits from 0 to 90 feet in the MLB.  

---

## Dataframe Usage
- **fulltable.csv**: Filtered to include only the user-selected baserunner.  
- **poptime.csv**: Used to retrieve the catcher’s pop time on stolen base attempts.  
- **runningsplits.csv**: Used to calculate running splits for the user-selected baserunner.
